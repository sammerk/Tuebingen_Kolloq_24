  abstract = {Teachers around the world are increasingly required by policy guidelines to inform their teaching practices with scientific evidence. However, due to the division of cognitive labor, teachers often cannot evaluate the veracity of such evidence first-hand, since they lack specific methodological skills, such as the ability to evaluate study designs. For this reason, second-hand evaluations come into play, during which individuals assess the credibility and trustworthiness of the person or other entity who conveys the evidence instead of evaluating the information itself. In doing so, teachers' belief systems (e.g., beliefs about the trustworthiness of different sources, about science in general, or about specific educational topics) can play a pivotal role. But judging evidence based on beliefs may also lead to distortions which, in turn, can result in barriers for evidence-informed school practice. One popular example is the so-called confirmation bias, that is, preferring belief-consistent and avoiding or questioning belief-inconsistent information. Therefore, we experimentally investigated (1) whether teachers trust knowledge claims made by other teachers and scientific studies differently, (2) whether there is an interplay between teachers' trust in these specific knowledge claims, their trust in educational science, and their global trust in science, and (3) whether their prior topic-specific beliefs influence trust ratings in the sense of a confirmation bias. In an incomplete rotated design with three preregistered hypotheses,               N               = 414 randomly and representative sampled in-service teachers from Germany indicated greater trust in scientific evidence (information provided by a scientific journal) compared to anecdotal evidence (information provided by another teacher on a teacher blog). In addition, we found a positive relationship between trust in educational science and trust in specific knowledge claims from educational science. Finally, participants also showed a substantial confirmation bias, as they trusted educational science claims more when these matched (rather than contradicted) their prior beliefs. Based on these results, the interplay of trust, first-hand evaluation, and evidence-informed school practice is discussed.},

Such research being unknown to other investigators may be repeated independently until eventually by chance a significant result occurs---an ``error of the first kind''---and is published. Significant results published in these fields are seldom verified by independent replication. The possibility thus arises that the literature of such a field consists in substantial part of false conclusions resulting from errors of the first kind in statistical tests of significance. * The author wishes to express his thanks to Sir Ronald Fisher whose discussion on related topics stimulated this research in the first place, and to Leo Katz, Oliver Lacey, Enders Robinson, and Paul Siegel for reading and criticizing earlier drafts of this manuscript. * The author wishes to express his thanks to Sir Ronald Fisher whose discussion on related topics stimulated this research in the first place, and to Leo Katz, Oliver Lacey, Enders Robinson, and Paul Siegel for reading and criticizing earlier drafts of this manuscript.}

  abstract = {Cases of clear scientific misconduct have received significant media attention recently, but less flagrantly questionable research practices may be more prevalent and, ultimately, more damaging to the academic enterprise. Using an anonymous elicitation format supplemented by incentives for honest reporting, we surveyed over 2,000 psychologists about their involvement in questionable research practices. The impact of truth-telling incentives on self-admissions of questionable research practices was positive, and this impact was greater for practices that respondents judged to be less defensible. Combining three different estimation methods, we found that the percentage of respondents who have engaged in questionable practices was surprisingly high. This finding suggests that some questionable practices may constitute the prevailing research norm.},

  abstract = {Introduction                                Across the globe, many national, state, and district level governments are increasingly seeking to bring about school ``self improvement''                 via                 the fostering of change, which, at best, is based on or informed by research, evidence, and data. According to the conceptualization of research-informed education as inquiry cycle, it is reasoned that there is value in combining the approaches of data-based decision-making and evidence-informed education. The originality of this paper lies in challenging common claims that teachers' engagement with research supports development processes at schools and pupil performance.                                                        Methods                                To put this assumption to test, a data-set based on 1,457 staff members from 73 English primary schools (school year 2014/2015) was (re-)analyzed in this paper. Not only survey information about trust among colleagues, organizational learning and the research use climate was used (                 cf                 . Brown et al., 2016), but also the results from the most recent school inspections and the results from standardized assessment at the end of primary school. Of particular interest was, as to whether the perceived research use climate mediates the association between organizational learning and trust at school on the one hand and the average pupil performance on the other, and whether schools that were rated as ``outstanding,'' ``good,'' or ``requires improvement'' in their most recent school inspection differ in that regard. Data was analyzed based on multi-level structural equation modelling.                                                        Results               Our findings indicate that schools with a higher average value of trust among colleagues report more organizational and research informed activities, but also demonstrate better results in the average pupil performance assessment at the end of the school year. This was particularly true for schools rated as ``good'' in previous school inspections. In contrast, both ``outstanding'' schools and schools that ``require improvement'' appeared to engage more with research evidence, even though the former seemed not to profit from it.                                         Discussion               The conclusion is drawn that a comprehensive model of research-informed education can contribute to more conceptual clarity in future research, and based on that, to theoretical development.},

Deshalb haben wir 274 Kinder und Erwachsene gebeten, die Antworten auf schwierige numerische Wissensfragen zu sch{\"a}tzen.

Die Ergebnisse zeigten einen deutlichen R{\"u}ckschaufehler, d. h. auf niedrige Werte erfolgten niedrigere Sch{\"a}tzungen als auf hohe Werte. Dieser Effekt war bei den Kindern st{\"a}rker ausgepr{\"a}gt als bei den Erwachsenen. Die Quelle des vorgegebenen Wertes (``Lehrerin`` oder ``Sch{\"u}ler``) wirkte sich dabei nicht aus.
